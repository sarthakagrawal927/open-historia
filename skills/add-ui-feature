TASK: Add UI Feature - $FEATURE_DESC

WORKFLOW:
1. Read relevant components in components/ and app/ directories
2. Understand the existing patterns (Tailwind, dark theme with slate/amber colors)
3. Create or modify components to implement the feature
4. Ensure type safety (no 'any' types)
5. Test the feature works
6. Commit with a clear message

TECH STACK:
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- D3.js for maps

Start by exploring the codebase, then implement incrementally." --yolo
